README for VDMOS model in NGSPICE
==================

A simmple MOS model for vertical power transistors (VDMOS model) is under
development. Originally it has been available in LTSPICE
(see http://ltwiki.org/LTspiceHelp/LTspiceHelp/M_MOSFET.htm) or
SuperSpice (https://www.anasoft.co.uk/MOS1Model.htm).

It is based on the MOS1 model. The Meyer capacitance has been
replaced by a special cap model. A body diode with series
resistance is parallel to the D/S device nodes. It defines the
reverse behavior, but also the breakdown of the transistor.

This is a work in progress.

Basic current equations for ac, dc and tran operations are
available as well as the capacitance model. Still missing is the
body diode and the subthreshold behavior.
